**Unit 3: Democratization** <span id="3"></span> 
*After enduring decades of dictatorships marred by political violence,
human rights abuses and widespread political violence and revolutions,
beginning in the mid-1970s, Latin America experienced a wave of
democratization.  By the 1990s, almost all the countries of the region
had democratically elected regimes and were continuing the process of
consolidating and deepening their democratic reforms.  These transitions
focused on building institutions that would encourage political
participation and encourage the protection of fundamental citizen
rights.  The first part of this unit will look at some indicators of
democracy, to provide an overview of just how democratic the countries
of the region have become.  Next, there is a set of readings that focus
on key institutions such as presidencies, legislatures, and political
parties and how the creation of these institutions has led to increased
citizen participation and governmental accountability. Afterwards,
special attention will be given to the role of women in the
democratization process.  In recent years, Latin America has had several
female presidents, more representation in elected offices, and a more
influential role at the grassroots level—all of which point to a
possible lessening of the traditional machismo culture that has long
characterized the region. *
