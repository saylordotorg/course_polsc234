**Unit 1: Foundations of Latin American Politics** <span id="1"></span> 
*To begin your study of the politics of Latin America and the Caribbean,
you will explore geographic factors that have shaped and influenced its
development.  Then, you will continue by looking at its people, both in
demographic and cultural terms.  Next, you will explore the history of
Latin America, starting with the stark transformation of pre-Hispanic
Indigenous civilizations during the European conquest.  *  
  
 *You will then study the features of European colonialism that served
to solidify inequality and economic dependency throughout the region.
 The specific histories of four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and
Mexico—will then be examined from their independence to contemporary
times.  These four countries are the most significant political actors
in the region and their development has influenced the region as a
whole.  The culture and politics of Argentina have been influenced more
by Europe than any other Latin American country; Brazil is the largest
country in the region and is the economic powerhouse of Latin America. 
Its culture and history have been distinctive due to the Portuguese
(rather than Spanish) colonization and large influx of Africans.  Cuba
is a Caribbean nation just 90 miles off the Florida coast.  Despite its
small size, it has had a deep political influence throughout the region
as a result of Fidel Castro’s socialist revolution more than 50 years
ago.  Finally, Mexico is the fourth representative country of Unit One,
chosen because of its proximity to the United States.  Its history and
development have been closely intertwined with that of the U.S.  Today,
Mexico is the second largest trading partner with the U.S. and is
closely tied to the U.S. on a number of issues including immigration and
illegal drugs.*
