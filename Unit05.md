**Unit 5: Current Regional Issues** <span id="5"></span> 
*The final unit of this course concludes by examining some major issues
that currently confront the nation: regional economic integration, the
war on drugs, immigration (both internal and external, and
globalization.  Economic integration among Latin American countries has
long been a goal of many governments of the region.  Looking toward the
European Union as a kind of model, the purpose of such integration was
to not only achieve economic self-sufficiency but also to cultivate
greater economic self-reliance in their pursuit of development goals and
regional security. *  
  
 *Since the independence of Central and South American colonies,
regional integration has been attempted in various forms with varying
degrees of success.  The goals of integration have included the
promotion of regional trade, lessening dependence on the U.S., and
creating a common identity and sense of purpose that would bind together
the countries of the continents of South, Central, and North America
(Mexico).  The first true efforts at aligning American interests across
the continents did not begin until as late as 1826, with the Congress of
Panama, organized and led by the visionary Simon Bolivar (founder of
Venezuela).  Over the last 175 years, these efforts continued but were
met with limited success.  For example, there have been over 20
region-wide conferences and conventions of the Americas designed to more
fully integrate the two continents.  One reason was the resistance by
the United States, which was wary of any efforts of Latin American
countries to integrate, knowing that successful integration would
provide a counter-weight to U.S. influence in the region.  Instead, the
U.S. pushed for the creation of an organization in which it was the
leader, creating the Organization of American States (formalized in
1890), with headquarters in Washington, D.C.  In 1994, the U.S., Canada,
and Mexico entered the North American Free Trade Association agreement
(NAFTA), the goal of which was to promote free trade on all goods and
services in the North American continent.  The success of NAFTA then
encouraged a more ambitious integration effort, known as Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA), developed in 1998.  This effort, however, has
floundered, especially after the election of leftist governments in
several countries that sought to distance themselves from the U.S., such
as the election of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez.  Chavez is the leftist
leader of Venezuela’s populist revolution, created the Bolivarian
Alliance of the Americas (formalized in 2004), an effort to establish
economic and security self-reliance independently of the U.S.  However,
political tensions continue to play an important part in preventing true
integration (for example, ongoing border disputes between Venezuela and
Colombia), and the U.S. has continued to use its economic might and
security concerns to prevent the autonomous integration of Latin
America.*  
  
 *The next issue that Unit 5 examines is the War on Drugs.  The
trafficking of illegal drugs (especially cocaine) and the United States’
effort to stop it has resulted in continued anti-American resentment,
political violence and terrorism, social instability, and economic
slowdown in the traditional (legal) economies of the region.  The War on
Drugs pits drug cartels and leftist guerilla movements against the
governments of the Latin America.  In the 1980s, Colombia was the
epicenter of this war, becoming one of the most dangerous and violent
countries of the world, with Medellin earning the dubious distinction as
the “murder capital” of the world.  By the late 1990s and early 2000s,
the main battleground shifted to Mexico, where today thousands of people
are killed each year in drug-related violence.*  
  
 *A third major issue confronting the region is immigration.  As with
all developing countries around the world, Latin American people are on
the move: from countryside to cities, and from country to country.  By
far, the biggest magnet for Latin Americans is the U.S., which continues
to attract hundreds of thousands of people each year, people in search
of economic security, better living conditions, and fulfillment of their
dreams.  This vast migration is fueled by a series of factors, which
push, pull, and facilitate the movement of people across borders, often
in highly dangerous conditions.  In this unit, you will look at both the
causes and consequences of immigration and how it affects the political
development of the region.*  
  
 *Finally, the unit concludes with an examination of a new actor in the
region: China.  China’s fast-paced industrialization and thirst for raw
materials provides a renewed impetus for economic growth in the region
and also provides a potential counterweight to U.S. influence.*

     Instructions: Watch this video in its entirety (27:53 minutes). 
    Latin America constitutes the largest source by far for immigrants,
    both legal and illegal, into the United States.  There are many
    factors that promote immigration: “push” factors are those
    circumstances in the home country that encourage people to leave,
    such as lack of jobs, low wages, high crime, political violence,
    discrimination, and poor education.  Immigration is also encouraged
    by “pull” factors in the U.S.:  high standard of living, relative
    stability and security, higher paying jobs, and the existence of
    family members who already live in the United States.  Finally,
    there are “facilitating” factors: the presence of long, mostly open
    land borders (especially with Canada and Mexico) and sea borders, as
    well as U.S. immigration laws that allow families to reunite rather
    easily or grant U.S. citizenship to any person born on U.S. soil. 
    The debate on immigration focuses on whether immigration creates a
    net benefit or cost to the U.S.  On the negative side, many argue
    that immigrants take away jobs, increase crime, and weigh down
    social welfare programs and schools with extra burden of support. 
    On the positive side, there are those who argue that immigrants
    satisfy the need of the job market for low-wage laborers, contribute
    entrepreneurial talents, and add to demographic and cultural
    diversity that is part of America’s “melting pot” culture.  
        
     As you view the video, take notes and answer to the following
    question:  
      
     1. What are some of the proposed solutions to the problem of
    illegal immigration offered by various speakers in the video?

     Instructions: Please read this entire article, which provides an
    in-depth view of Venezuela’s oil politics.  Venezuela is the
    hemisphere’s largest producer of oil and has used its oil wealth for
    political purposes more than any other country of the world.
    Venezuela is not only America’s biggest supplier, but it also has
    the world’s largest reserves of oil in the world, exceeding that of
    Saudi Arabia.  However, the anti-American leftist President of
    Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, has used his country’s oil wealth to pursue
    a number of policies designed to promote his socialist agenda at
    home and to strengthen his country’s autonomy with respect to the
    U.S. and abroad.  As you watch the video, take notes and answer the
    following questions:  
      
     1.     What have been the positive and negative effects of
    Venezuela’s dependence on oil export revenues?  
     2.     What kinds of social projects have been funded by the oil
    revenues?  Have these projects succeeded in reducing poverty and
    inequality in the nation?  
     3.     How has Chavez used his country’s oil wealth to play a
    leading role in regional integration in South America?

     Instructions: From the Latin American perspective, globalization
    has created more opportunities for the countries of the region to
    develop ties outside the United States’ sphere of influence. 
    China’s hunger for minerals, oil, and other raw materials has given
    a big boost to Latin American exports and has helped them redress
    their former balance of payments deficits.   
     Read this article for an overview of the growing ties with China,
    and pay special attention to the fact that Latin America’s
    relationship with China is a kind of “double-edged sword.”  Take
    notes from the article and answer the following questions:  
      
     1. What kinds of products are Latin American countries exporting to
    China?   
     2. Which countries of Latin America are benefitting the most?  
     3. In the longer term, why is this new-found economic relationship
    with China potentially harmful?
