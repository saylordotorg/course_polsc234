**Unit 2: Political Economy of Development** <span id="2"></span> 
*As you have seen from Unit 1, high levels of poverty and inequality
have been persistent features of the entire region of Latin America and
the Caribbean throughout its history.  As a result, the most important
political challenge the region has faced has been trying to establish a
set of economic and social strategies to lessen poverty and inequality
and achieve sustainable growth.  The term “political economy” refers to
the interaction of politics and economics; on the one hand, the
governments of the region use political means to achieve growth, and on
the other hand, the economic challenges often lead to (negative)
political consequences.  Since the end of the colonial period, the
political economy of the region has been characterized by oscillation
and experimentation among different economic and political models.  This
unit will focus on the major theories that have strongly influenced the
governments and policymakers in their struggle to achieve sustained
growth.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will examine the current socio-economic status of
the region and review the major challenges still facing the region.  You
will see that poverty, inequality, inflation, and debt have been major
recurring challenges.  The main goal of most leaders has been trying to
establish an economic strategy and set of policies that would
successfully solve these problems and put their countries on the path of
sustainable development. To get a clearer picture of where Latin America
is today in terms of economic and social development, you will take a
look at some indicators of socio-economic development, from respected
publications such as the* World Development Report, *which has been
published annually by the World Bank since 1978, and other publications
by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean (ECLAC).  These organizations provide the most authoritative
resources for better understanding the status of developing states in
the world today and will serve as a starting point for exploring the
continued persistence of poverty and inequality across Latin America and
the Caribbean. *  
  
 *The remainder of Unit 2 will review past and current development
theories and strategies, as well as examine their results—both positive
and negative.  There have been four major theories of economic
development that have most influenced policymaking in the region: 
structuralism, the linear stages of growth model, dependency, and
neo-classicalism (also known neo-liberalism).  Since the late 1980s,
neoliberalism has been the dominant model. The key question is “how much
has changed?”*  
  
 *Today, the neoliberal model of development has been challenged in some
countries by a revival of populist policies that focus on acquiring
government control of major resources (for example, oil and minerals)
and using governmental power to force the redistribution of wealth. 
These governments seek to mobilize support for their policies from the
large numbers of poor indigenous groups within their countries (hence,
they are called “populist,” meaning they get their support from the
population).  The governments of Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador are
examples of countries that have rejected the neo-liberal model in favor
of a more populist development model.*

**2.2.3 Linear Stages of Growth Model (Modernization Theory)** <span
id="2.2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The University of Iowa Center’s for International Finance
    and Development: Ricardo Contreras’s “Part1-III Competing Theories
    of Economic Development”**
    Link: The University of Iowa’s Center for International Finance and

    (HTML or PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The Linear Stages of Growth Model (more popularly
    known as Modernization Theory) has dominated European perspectives
    for the past several decades.  In America, one of the main
    proponents of this model was Walt Rostow, who was an influential
    advisor to President Kennedy.  In fact, Modernization Theory and its
    assumptions underpinned the Kennedy Administration’s approach to
    Latin America, especially his Alliance for Progress, with its
    attendant programs of economic aid and human resource and technology
    transfer through the creation of the Peace Corps (see Unit 4 below
    for more details).  In simplest terms, this theory said that all
    countries went through distinct stages of development, progressing
    from primitive, agricultural-based societies to more advanced
    industrial and service-based economies.  An important feature of
    this model of growth is that developing countries could become more
    “modern” by trading with more developed countries via the transfer
    of technology and knowledge. This theory, therefore, directly
    contradicted Dependency Theory, which says that close ties between
    developing and developed countries leads to underdevelopment, not
    modernization.

    Please read Section C: “The Linear Stages of Growth Model,” and
    answer the following questions:  
        
     1.     According to Walt Rostow, what are the five stages of
    modernization and development all countries go through?  
     2.     How did Rostow’s theory differ from the structuralists?  
     3.     Why was Rostow’s theory and its policy prescriptions
    ineffective in the Latin American context?

**2.2.4 Neo-Marxist Theory** <span id="2.2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: The University of Iowa’s Center for International Finance
    and Development: Ricardo Contreras’s “Part1-III Competing Theories
    of Economic Development”**
    Link: The University of Iowa Center’s for International Finance and
    Development: Ricardo Contreras’s “[Part1-III Competing Theories of
    Economic
    Development](http://blogs.law.uiowa.edu/ebook/uicifd-ebook/part-1-iii-competing-theories-economic-development)”
    (HTML or PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Neo-Marxist theorists take a much more drastic
    perspective than the structuralists.  They explain Latin America’s
    lack of development as rooted in the inherently exploitative nature
    of capitalism.  Not only do Latin American countries face economic
    exploitation from advanced capitalist countries through declining
    terms of trade (as the structuralists argued), but also from
    exploitative labor relations (low wages, discouragement of labor
    unions, low taxes for big business, etc.), but also exploitative
    social, political, and military relationships.  Latin American
    neo-Marxists would point to the numerous instances of American
    intervention in Latin America (see Unit 4 for more details) as proof
    of imperialism and exploitation.  Because of the vast power and
    resources at the hands of the capitalists (big business), which are
    supported by the U.S. government, many Neo-Marxists believed that
    the only way to solve the development dilemma was by eliminating the
    capitalist class within their own countries, seizing their property
    for redistribution, and cutting all ties with the United States.  Of
    course, such actions would inevitably provoke violence and class
    warfare; this is exactly what occurred in several countries of the
    region, most notably Cuba (see subunit 2.3 for more information).

    (HTML or PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The Neo-Classical (more popularly known as
    “neo-liberal”) approach to development is based on traditional
    theories of free market economics.  The main assumption is that
    government intervention in the economy creates inefficiencies and
    hinders development.  Neo-liberals advocate creation of free-trade
    agreements, diversification of exports, and transfer of technology
    and knowledge as keys to development.  The effectiveness of these
    policies will be explored below in subunit 2.4 “How Much Has
    Changed?”

    (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: This video will explore the achievements of the 1979
    socialist revolution in Nicaragua.  The Sandinistas (FSLN), a
    Marxist revolutionary mass movement, succeeded in overthrowing a
    corrupt dictatorship of the Somoza family that had been in power
    since the 1930s and was long supported by the U.S. government and
    corporations.  Using the Cuban revolution as a model, they sought to
    reconstruct Nicaragua’s economy and society into a more egalitarian
    society and to reduce their economic dependence on the U.S.

     Instructions: In sub-subunits 2.4.1 through 2.4.3, you will explore
    the results of neo-liberal economic policies that have dominated the
    region since the 1980s.  Only a few countries with strong leftist
    populist governments (Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador) have
    rejected the neo-liberal model, while all the other governments of
    the region have adopted it (to varying degrees).  The key question
    is: has neo-liberalism succeeded in spurring economic and social
    development, especially the lessening of poverty and inequality?
     While some see success (sub-subunit 2.4.1), others see failure and
    the need to move on (sub-subunits 2.4.2 and 2.4.3).  As you watch
    and listen to these different perspectives, you are encouraged to
    think critically and formulate your own judgments.  
      
     This video (2 minutes in length) is a product of the OECD’s
    Development Center.  The OECD is a global organization of (mainly)
    advanced capitalist countries, and it is one of the major proponents
    of the neo-liberal model of development. Watch this video for a
    short summary of the progress Latin America has recently experienced
    under the neo-liberal model, as well as some persistent roadblocks
    that have yet to be overcome.  Then, answer the following
    questions:  
        
     1.  What are the main areas of progress Latin America has recently
    made in its development?  
     2.  What are continuing obstacles?

     Instructions: In contrast to the preceding video, this 2-part video
    (8:57 and 9:32 minutes, respectively) has a much more pessimistic
    assessment of neo-liberalism and free-market capitalism.  Note how
    Dr. Gerard Dumenil, Professor of Economics at the University of
    Paris, makes a connection between the continuing poverty and
    inequality in Latin America one the one hand, with the 1998
    financial crisis (precipitated by “big financial capitalists of Wall
    Street) and anti-Wall Street protests throughout the U.S. during
    2011.  As you watch the video, take notes and answer the following
    questions:  
      
     1.     (Part 1) How is neo-liberalism defined?  
     2.     (Part 1) How does he define globalization?  How did
    globalization facilitate the strengthening of neo-liberalism?  
     3.     (Part 1) According to Professor Dumenil, what is the primary
    objective of neo-liberal policymakers, especially in the U.S.?  
     4.     (Part 1) How did neo-liberal policies contribute to the 2008
    global financial crash?  
     5.     (Part 2) How did neo-liberalism provoke popular resistance? 
    Give country-specific examples from the video.  
     6.     (Part 2) What demands should citizens make on their
    governments in order to ameliorate the negative effects of
    neo-liberal policies (for example, the reduction of workers’
    purchasing power, loss of jobs, tightening credit, and slimming down
    of employee benefits)?
