**Unit 4: The United States and Latin America** <span id="4"></span> 
*From its historical legacy as a series of European colonies through
revolution and modern times, Latin America has often been defined by its
close proximity to the United States of America.  Speaking of Mexico in
the mid-1900s, longtime dictator and president of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz
(1830-1915) described this relationship as follows:* *"¡Pobre*
[*México*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9xico "México")*! ¡Tan
lejos de Dios y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos!"  (“Poor Mexico, so far
from God and so close to the* [*United
States*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States")*!”) 
Much of Latin America, for right or wrong, would express this same
sentiment.*  
 *Latin Americans have long had a “love-hate” relationship with the U.S.
 On the one-hand, Latin Americans are enamored with American culture and
admire its technological, economic, and political strengths.  On the
other hand, they are highly suspicious and resentful of the way the
United States’ government has often exercised its great power throughout
the region.  This is largely because of the United States’ long and deep
involvement throughout the region, including numerous military
interventions; support for dictators; secret plots to remove or
assassinate anti-American political leaders; and countless legal,
economic, and political manipulations designed to maintain and promote
U.S. interests and power in the region.  *
