Course Syllabus for "POLSC324: Latin American/Caribbean Politics"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*"(Latin) America is ungovernable; all who have served the revolution
have plowed the sea!" * Simon Bolivar, liberator of much of South
America, spoke these famous words on his deathbed in 1830 while
reflecting on what he deemed the failure of democracy to take root in
Latin America in the early part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Looking
through the historical struggles in Latin America and the Caribbean over
the last century and a half, these words continue to hold some truth. 
The story of Latin America is one of inequality, complexity, failures,
and unrealized possibilities.  Latin America and the Caribbean have
entered into the 21<sup>st</sup> century with a legacy of persistent
poverty, authoritarianism, corruption, and inequality. This course will
introduce you to the politics of Latin America and the Caribbean and
examine the causes and effects of the region’s development.  In many
ways, Latin American/Caribbean politics defies any sort of coherent
logic attempting to bring it together, a fact that is much reflected in
the field of Latin American studies.  Instead of approaching the field
in pursuit of one central theme, you must come at the topic from
multiple directions and different perspectives. You will begin Unit 1:
Foundations of Latin American Politics by examining the geographic,
cultural, social, and historical foundations of Latin American and
Caribbean politics.  As you shall see, the long period of colonialism
has left a strong imprint on the region, strongly influencing the
development of political institutions and behavior.  The region’s
politics is also strongly influenced by social pressures, geographic
factors, and unique cultural traits. Unit 2: Political Economy of
Development looks at the major contending theories used to describe and
explain socio-economic and political development (or the lack thereof)
of this vibrant region.  Some of these theories were developed according
to North American and European scholars’ assumptions about
modernization; other theories were developed from the perspective of
Latin American scholars and their direct experiences.  Despite important
differences in how they explain Latin American development, a common
theme of these theories is the effort to explain the uneven economic
development and the persistence of poverty and inequality that have been
at the root of many of the region’s political upheavals and revolutions
and reactions. Unit 3: Democratization examines the causes and process
by which most of Latin America became more democratic.  By the 1990s,
almost all the countries of the region had democratically elected
regimes and were continuing the process of consolidating and deepening
their democratic reforms.  This unit will examine the institutions of
democracy, such as the balance of power between legislatures and
executives and electoral processes.  The unit will also give special
attention to the political role of women in traditional male-dominated
societies. Unit 4: U.S. – Latin American Relations looks at Latin
America’s almost 200 year relationship with the United States.  The
United States government and American corporations have been important
actors in the Latin American political arena.  The United States has
long-viewed the region as its rightful “sphere of influence” and has
often intervened in the region to protect its perceived security and
economic interests, in what is sometimes described as neocolonialism. 
These interventions have taken myriad forms, ranging from economic and
social development policies, covert operations, and even outright
military intervention.  The unit will examine how the United States’
role has shaped its political relations with the region. Finally, Unit
5: Current Regional Issues explores several contemporary issues that
most countries of the region face: trade and economic integration; drug
trafficking and the U.S.-led “war on drugs;” immigration (legal and
illegal); and the rise of a new challenger to U.S. traditional
domination of the region: China. **

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC324.  Below, please find some general information about
the course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**: Dr. Kenneth L. Johnson

**Primary Resource:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, there is one resource that will be
extensively used in Unit 3:

-   MIT OpenCourseWare: [The Conquest of the
    Americas](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-441-the-conquest-of-america-spring-2004/lecture-notes/)
-   The University of Iowa Center’s for International Finance and
    Development: Ricardo Contreras’s “[Part1-III Competing Theories of
    Economic
    Development](http://blogs.law.uiowa.edu/ebook/uicifd-ebook/part-1-iii-competing-theories-economic-development)”
-   International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance: J.
    Marc Payne et al.’s [*Democracies in Development, Inter-American
    Development
    Bank*](http://www.idea.int/publications/dem_dev/):Several chapters
    of this online book will form the basis of Unit 3: 
    Democratization.  It is suggested that you go ahead and download the
    PDF file to your computer for your convenience.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in later
units.  You will also need to complete:

-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** The total amount of time required to complete this
course is approximately **75 hours**.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 13
hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Monday; subunit 1.2 and
sub-subunit 1.3.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  By making
such a schedule and setting goals for each day of study, you will be
able to complete the course in the allotted time.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Before reading or watching each of the resources,
it is important to review the instructions for each resource and the
accompanying study questions, which will contain key concepts and
vocabulary that you are expected to learn from that resource.  As you
work through the resource, write notes in accordance with the study
questions.  These study questions will provide you with the basis for
reviewing the material for your Final Exam.
